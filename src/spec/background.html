<p>Denaturing&nbsp;capillary electrophoresis&nbsp;is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In overview, a nucleic acid sample is injected at the inlet end of the capillary, into a denaturing separation medium in the capillary, and an electric field is applied to the capillary ends. The different nucleic acid components in a sample, e.g., a polymerase&nbsp;chain reaction (PCR) mixture or other sample, migrate to the detector point with different velocities due to differences in their electrophoretic properties. Consequently, they reach the detector (usually an ultraviolet (UV) or fluorescence detector) at different times. Results present as a series of detected peaks, where each peak represents ideally one nucleic acid component or species of the sample. Peak area and/or peak height indicate&nbsp;the initial concentration of the component in the mixture.</p>
<p>The magnitude of any given peak, including an artifact peak, is most often determined optically on the basis of either UV absorption by nucleic acids, e.g., DNA, or by fluorescence emission from one or more labels associated with the nucleic acid. UV and fluorescence detectors applicable to nucleic acid CE detection are well known in the art.</p>
<p>CE capillaries themselves are frequently quartz, although other materials known to those of skill in the art can be used. There are a number of CE systems available commercially, having both single and multiple-capillary capabilities. The methods described herein are applicable to any device or system&nbsp;for denaturing CE of nucleic acid samples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the charge-to-frictional drag ratio is the same for different sized polynucleotides in free solution, electrophoretic separation requires the presence of a sieving (i.e., separation) medium. &nbsp;Applicable CE separation matrices are compatible with the presence of denaturing agents necessary for denaturing nucleic acid CE, a common example of which is 8M urea.</p>
