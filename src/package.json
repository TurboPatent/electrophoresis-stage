        "definition": "a DNA sequencing process that takes advantage of the ability of DNA polymerase to incorporate 2´,3´-dideoxynucleotides—nucleotide base analogs that lack the 3´-hydroxyl group essential in phosphodiester bond formation. Sanger dideoxy sequencing requires a DNA template, a sequencing primer, DNA polymerase, deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), and reaction buffer. Four separate reactions are set up, each containing radioactively labeled nucleotides and either ddA, ddC, ddG, or ddT. The annealing, labeling, and termination steps are performed on separate heat blocks. DNA synthesis is performed at 37°C, the temperature at which DNA polymerase has the optimal enzyme activity. DNA polymerase adds a deoxynucleotide or the corresponding 2´,3´-dideoxynucleotide at each step of chain extension. Whether a deoxynucleotide or a dideoxynucleotide is added depends on the relative concentration of both molecules. When a deoxynucleotide (A, C, G, or T) is added to the 3´ end, chain extension can continue. However, when a dideoxynucleotide (ddA, ddC, ddG, or ddT) is added to the 3´ end, chain extension 4 DNA Sequencing by Capillary terminates . Sanger dideoxy sequencing results in the formation of extension products of various lengths terminated with dideoxynucleotides at the 3´ end."

Quality values are a measure of the certainty of the base calling and consensus-calling algorithms. Higher values correspond to lower chance of algorithm error. Sample quality values refer to the perbase quality values for a sample, and consensus quality values are per-consensus quality values."

        "term": "beam search",
        "definition": "a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set. Beam search is an optimization of best-first search that reduces its memory requirements. Best-first search is a graph search which orders all partial solutions (states) according to some heuristic. But in beam search, only a predetermined number of best partial solutions are kept as candidates.[1] It is thus a greedy algorithm.\nBeam search uses breadth-first search to build its search tree. At each level of the tree, it generates all successors of the states at the current level, sorting them in increasing order of heuristic cost.[2] However, it only stores a predetermined number, β, of best states at each level (called the beam width). Only those states are expanded next. The greater the beam width, the fewer states are pruned. With an infinite beam width, no states are pruned and beam search is identical to breadth-first search. The beam width bounds the memory required to perform the search. Since a goal state could potentially be pruned, beam search sacrifices completeness (the guarantee that an algorithm will terminate with a solution, if one exists). Beam search is not optimal (that is, there is no guarantee that it will find the best solution).\nIn general, beam search returns the first solution found. Beam search for machine translation is a different case: once reaching the configured maximum search depth (i.e. translation length), the algorithm will evaluate the solutions found during search at various depths and return the best one (the one with the highest probability).\nThe beam width can either be fixed or variable. One approach that uses a variable beam width starts with the width at a minimum. If no solution is found, the beam is widened and the procedure is repeated."
