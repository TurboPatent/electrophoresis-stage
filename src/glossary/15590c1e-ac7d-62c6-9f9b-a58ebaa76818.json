  "term": "capillary electrophoresis genetic analyzer",
  "definition": "insturment that applies an electrical field to a capilary loaded with a sample so that the negatively charged DNA fragments move toward the positive electrode. The speed at which a DNA fragment moves through the medium is inversely proportional to its molecular weight. This process of electrophoresis can separate the extension products by size at a resolution of one base."
