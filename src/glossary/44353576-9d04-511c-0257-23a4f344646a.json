  "term": "Sanger Sequencer",
  "definition": "a DNA sequencing process that takes advantage of the ability of DNA polymerase to incorporate 2´,3´-dideoxynucleotides—nucleotide base analogs that lack the 3´-hydroxyl group essential in phosphodiester bond formation. Sanger dideoxy sequencing requires a DNA template, a sequencing primer, DNA polymerase, deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), and reaction buffer. Four separate reactions are set up, each containing radioactively labeled nucleotides and either ddA, ddC, ddG, or ddT. The annealing, labeling, and termination steps are performed on separate heat blocks. DNA synthesis is performed at 37°C, the temperature at which DNA polymerase has the optimal enzyme activity. DNA polymerase adds a deoxynucleotide or the corresponding 2´,3´-dideoxynucleotide at each step of chain extension. Whether a deoxynucleotide or a dideoxynucleotide is added depends on the relative concentration of both molecules. When a deoxynucleotide (A, C, G, or T) is added to the 3´ end, chain extension can continue. However, when a dideoxynucleotide (ddA, ddC, ddG, or ddT) is added to the 3´ end, chain extension 4 DNA Sequencing by Capillary terminates . Sanger dideoxy sequencing results in the formation of extension products of various lengths terminated with dideoxynucleotides at the 3´ end."
